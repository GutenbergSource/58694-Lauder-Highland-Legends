<HTML><BODY>This collection of Legends from Scotland was originally published in two volumes in 1837 under the title <i>Highland Rambles and Long Legends to Shorten the Way</i>. This is a 1880 reprint in one volume.

<p>Overall, this is an easy text. Since the source copy was very brittle, a few pages are slightly damaged. Please report these when you encounter them; as I can replace them with alternative scans. In most cases, it will be easy to make out the text, but you could also use the alternative scans to confirm issues. (The source of scans used is <a href="https://archive.org/details/highlandlegends00lauduoft">here</a>, alternative scans from Google are <a href="https://archive.org/details/highlanderlegen00laudgoog">here</a>; scans of the first edition are here: <a href="https://archive.org/details/highlandrambles01laudgoog">vol 1</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/highlandrambles00unkngoog">vol 1</a>; <a href="https://archive.org/details/highlandrambles00laudgoog">vol 2</a>).
